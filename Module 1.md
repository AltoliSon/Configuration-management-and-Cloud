# Part 1. Introduction to automation at Scale
This lecture provides an overview of infrastructure as code and its significance in managing and provisioning infrastructure.
### What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
- IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.
- It allows for the automation of infrastructure setup, making it faster, more efficient, and less error-prone.
### Benefits of IaC"
- Improved consistency and reliability: IaC helps ensure that infrastructure is provisioned and configured consistently, reducing the risk of human errors.
- Increased efficiency and speed: Automating infrastructure management tasks through code speeds up the process and frees up IT staff for other tasks.
